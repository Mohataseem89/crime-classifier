# Crime Classifier  

A machine learning project that classifies crime report narratives into categories using **NLTK** and **scikit-learn**.  
The goal is to demonstrate natural language processing (NLP) techniques for text preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification.

## Features  
- Preprocessing of crime report text with:  
  - Lowercasing, punctuation removal, and stemming (Snowball Stemmer).  
  - Stopword filtering.  
  - Word bigram generation for context.  
- Two classification models implemented:  
  - **Linear SVC (Support Vector Classifier)**  
  - **Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt)**  
- Training and testing pipeline with accuracy evaluation.  
- Customizable training and test datasets (CSV format).
